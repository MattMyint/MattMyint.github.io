The current understanding of genetic susceptibility factors for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is still incomplete. To identify novel germline variants associated with NPC predisposition, we analysed whole-exome sequencing data from 119 NPC patients from Singapore with a family history of NPC and/or with early-onset NPC, together with 1337 Singaporean participants without NPC. Variants were prioritised and filtered by selecting variants with minor allele frequencies of <1% in both local control (n = 1337) and gnomAD non-cancer (EAS) (n = 9626) cohorts and a high pathogenicity prediction (CADD score > 20). Using single-variant testing, we identified 17 rare pathogenic variants in 17 genes that were associated with NPC. Consistent evidence of enrichment in NPC patients was observed for five of these variants (in JAK2, PRDM16, LRP1B, NIN, and NKX2-1) from an independent case-control comparison of 156 NPC patients and 9770 unaffected individuals. In a family with five siblings, a FANCE variant (p. P445S) was detected in two affected members, but not in three unaffected members. Gene-based burden testing recapitulated variants in NKX2-1 and FANCE as being associated with NPC risk. Using pathway analysis, endocytosis and immune-modulating pathways were found to be enriched for mutation burden. This study has identified NPC-predisposing variants and genes which could shed new insights into the genetic predisposition of NPC.
