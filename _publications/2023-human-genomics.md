Cancer predisposition is most often studied in the context of single cancers. However, inherited cancer predispositions can also give rise to multiple primary cancers. Yet, there is a paucity of studies on genetic predisposition in multiple primary cancers, especially those outside of well-defined cancer predisposition syndromes. This study aimed to identify germline variants associated with dual primary cancers of the breast and lung.
