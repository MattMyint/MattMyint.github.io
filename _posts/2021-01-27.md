# Welcome to my thoughts
While I set this website up primarily as a resume/portfolio, I figured why not use these blog posts to practice my writing.

### Why am I doing this?
For quite a while now, I've come across thoughts or ideas that left a strong impression on me, but were soon gone with the wind since I didn't note them down. I'm hoping that through this exercise, I can use this blog to circle back to earlier writings, as well as check in on my growth as a person and as a professional.

### What will I post about? 
Hopefully anything that I feel worth writing about. It could be a recounting of my thought process as I develop a workflow for my analytical work, or some reflections from a talk or workshop I attend. If it matters that much, I might go on at length about a movie/book/game that I like.

### How often will I write?
A weekly reflection would be a good start. While things may change with the ebb and flow of work and school, there will be a strong effort to at least maintain this frequency.
